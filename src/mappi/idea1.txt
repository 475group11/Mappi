Compare acceleration from LIDAR/localization and from IMU

If LIDAR reports an acceleration but IMU does not, assume that LIDAR is wrong,
and enter non-LIDAR mode. In this mode, do not use LIDAR for localization.

To return to the normal mode: Detect an acceleration that both the IMU and
LIDAR data reflect
(or when the LIDAR data show non-zero velocity?)
(or when the LIDAR reports an acceleration in the opposite direction of its
initial acceleration, and the IMU reports no acceleration? This would happen
if the device's velocity did not change, and the LIDAR processing suddenly detected
a wall and realized that the device was moving.)
