Compare acceleration from LIDAR/localization and from IMU

If LIDAR reports an acceleration but IMU does not, assume that LIDAR is wrong,
and enter non-LIDAR mode. In this mode, do not use LIDAR for localization.

To return to the normal mode: Detect an acceleration that both the IMU and
LIDAR data reflect
(or when the LIDAR data show non-zero velocity?)
